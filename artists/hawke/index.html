          <div id="bio">
            <p>Jennifer Hawke hails from Billings, Montana where they got their degree in Cast Metals and Painting. They have been on Vashon Island for about 18 years and love doing the Bearded Lady Road Report. They have had their Studio at the Beall Greenhouses for about 8 years and only recently started opening to the public. Their space is warmed by a singular woodstove & all the ephemera that comes with being the child of an antique dealer.</p>
